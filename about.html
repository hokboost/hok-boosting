 <h2>🧑‍💼 About Me</h2>

<p>Hey, I’m a professional Honor of Kings booster with over 5 seasons of duo queue experience. I’ve helped players across multiple regions climb safely and quickly — all while playing their own accounts, without any account sharing.</p>

<p>I specialize in win-focused boosting with smart strategies — like using low-score partner accounts to match into easier games and speed up the climb. I adapt to any role and keep things smooth, chill, and consistent.</p>

<p>Apart from boosting, I’m passionate about working on pure math problems in my free time. Recently, I’ve been diving into <strong>analytic number theory</strong> and having a blast solving problems from Ram Murty’s <em>Problems in Analytic Number Theory</em>. It’s one of my favorite ways to relax and stay mentally sharp.</p>

<p>I also really enjoy listening to and singing music — especially songs by <strong>JJ Lin</strong> and <strong>Jay Chou</strong>. Singing helps me destress after long boosting sessions, and even though I totally sing off-pitch (haha), it’s something I genuinely love doing!</p>
