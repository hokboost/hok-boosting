  <h2>🧑‍💼 About Me</h2>

<p>Hey, I’m a professional Honor of Kings booster with over 5 seasons of duo queue experience. I’ve helped players across multiple regions climb safely and quickly — all while playing their own accounts, without any account sharing.</p>

<p>I specialize in win-focused boosting with smart strategies — like using low-score partner accounts to match into easier games and speed up the climb. I adapt to any role and keep things smooth, chill, and consistent.</p>

<p>Apart from boosting, I’m passionate about working on pure math problems in my free time. Lately, I’ve been really interested in <strong>analytic number theory</strong>, and I’ve been enjoying solving problems from Ram Murty’s book <em>Problems in Analytic Number Theory</em>. For me, it’s genuinely fun and relaxing — just like outplaying a teamfight 😄</p>
